                <p>Hi, I'm Shan! I'm a passionate developer from the Philippines with experience in various technologies. I love building innovative solutions and exploring new advancements in the tech world.</p>
                <p>With a background in computer science, I have worked on diverse projects ranging from web development to data analysis. My goal is to continuously enhance my skills and contribute to impactful projects that make a difference.</p>
                <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me reading books, playing video games, or Playing with my friends</p>
                <p>I primarily use Lua for scripting in Roblox Studio, where I also enjoy creating models and visual effects. Additionally, I have a keen interest in history and science, which I find both entertaining and enlightening.</p>
